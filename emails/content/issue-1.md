## Want To Make Money Working On Open Source?

I've been working on a privacy-oriented alternative to Disqus called [ParlezVous](https://parlezvous.io/). I [announced](https://discourse.elm-lang.org/t/parlezvous-disqus-alternative-built-in-elm/6716) ParlezVous on several social circles at the start of the year, and in that announcement I mentioned that I needed to start looking for employement opportunities since ParlezVous is not yet making any revenue.

> Sidenote: Yes I'm aware of that aweful social website called Parler. So I am considering renaming the project to something else.

Shortly after my announcement, I got approached by an interesting company to do some freelancing work. Therefore, I won't have a lot of time to work on ParlezVous so **I am looking for a partner and contributors to help keep ParlezVous alive**.

I may be able to pay for contributions to the codebase on an hourly basis. So you'd literally be paid for open source. We could also work out a deal where we share revenue or something like that. **This is a great mentorship opportunity as well** if you're looking to work with Elm (or functional programming in general), devops and launching products.

## Writing

### "NeverThrow + Subtyping = ❤️"

I wrote a [little blog post](https://gdelgado.ca/neverthrow-subtyping.html#title) on `neverthrow` on why the API is beginning to stray away from traditional implementations of a `Result` / `Either` type.


### Notes On "The Art Of SQL"

I dedicated some time to reading ["The Art of SQL"](https://www.amazon.ca/Art-SQL-Stephane-Faroult/dp/0596008945/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+art+of+sql&qid=1612112617&sr=8-1&tag=duc22-20) and took some notes on it.
